/*
Big-O (Upper Bound)
Theta (Average Bound)
Omega (Lower Bound)


-> Mostly We Use Big-O (Worst-Case).
-> We are concerned with Worst Case.

-> Constant Time O(1)           (Lets say for loop running for 10 times, So it is obious that it is constant time.)
-> Linear Time O(n)             (for loop running depending on input n)
-> Logarithmic Time O(logn)     (Binary Search)
-> Quadratic Time O(n(square))  (Nested for loops)
-> Cubic Time O(n(cube))        (Tripple for loops)



O(N!)                     Highest
O(2 power n)
O(n power 3)
O(n power 2)
O(nlogn)
O(n)
O(logn)
O(1)                      Lowest
